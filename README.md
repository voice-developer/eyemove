# Alexa APL/APLA & Motion API demo


## Skill Architecture
This skill started life as the Alexa Hello World Template.
I then added APL, APLA, & the Motion API (with the APL document)

## Getting APL & Motion API working
* To get APL working, you need to select the APL option within the Alexa Developer console > Interfaces > APL (Tick for echo show 5 whilst you're at it).
* When activating APL also click to activate the Motion & Sensing API extentions, and set the quick start policy to "Follow on Wake Word".
